   - Original Bucket Sort shows 74.91% improvement vs QuickSort
   - AHB Sort improves upon Original Bucket Sort by 36.94%

2. **Data Pattern Performance**
   - Best performance with random data (92.71% speedup)
   - Strong performance with duplicates (88.98% speedup)
   - Efficient handling of nearly sorted data (80.63% speedup)

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Consistently outperforms Radix Sort (75.12% average speedup)
   - Most significant improvements seen with large random datasets
   - Maintains efficiency across all data patterns

These results demonstrate AHB Sort's effectiveness as a general-purpose sorting algorithm, particularly for large datasets where its optimizations provide the most benefit.

## How It Works üîç

AHB Sort is built on the foundation of bucket sort but incorporates several optimizations and adaptive strategies:

1. **Initial Checks**
   - Handles edge cases (empty or single-element arrays)
   - Detects already sorted sequences
   - Uses insertion sort for small arrays (n ‚â§ 16)

2. **Smart Bucket Distribution**
   - Calculates optimal bucket count based on data variance
   - Adapts to data distribution patterns
   - Balances memory usage and performance

3. **Hybrid Sorting Approach**
   - Combines bucket sort with insertion sort
   - Uses adaptive thresholds based on array size
   - Optimizes for different data patterns

## Optimizations in Detail ‚ö°

### 1. Early Exit Strategies
- Immediate return for single-element arrays
- Detection of pre-sorted sequences
- Size-based algorithm selection
- Small array optimization with insertion sort

### 2. Statistical Optimizations
- Single-pass variance calculation
- Combined min/max/sum gathering
- Loop unrolling (4 elements at a time)
- Efficient statistical calculations for bucket distribution

### 3. Memory Management
- Single contiguous memory allocation
- Cache-friendly memory layout
- Reduced memory fragmentation
- Efficient memory reuse

### 4. Distribution Techniques
- Multiplication-based bucket indexing
- Unrolled counting and distribution loops
- Dynamic bucket count calculation
